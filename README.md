# click2switch

When you're opening a link in a new tab, this extension will identify if you already have a tab opened with the URL that was clicked (exact match only for now) and will switch to it if that's the case.

# Install

This is unpublished yet. To use it:

$ git clone git@github.com:ematsumiya/click2switch.git

In Firefox, go to `about:debugging` and then click `Load Temporary Add-on`. Navigate to where you cloned this repo and open the file "manifest.json".

Select `Enable add-on debugging` to debug/devel.

The extension will stay loaded until you reset the browser.

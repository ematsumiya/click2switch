- When opening a "_blank" link, main functionality will not work (i.e. tab query
does not kick in)
- I initially wanted it to happen only when some key press was activated:
  e.g. I map alt+shift+click link to activate functionality
  This is not the current case. It applies to every link clicked (caveat: with
  either ctrl pressed or middle mouse button click)
- Maybe introduce an option to select the first matched tab (i.e. the first opened
  tab with the target URL, and close all other duplicates)

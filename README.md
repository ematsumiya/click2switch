# click2switch

When opening a URL, this extension will identify if the URL is already opened in
some tab and switch to it if so (exact match only for now).

# Instal

This is unpublished yet. To use it:

$ git clone git@github.com:ematsumiya/click2switch.git

In Firefox, open `about:debugging` and then `Load Temporary Add-on`. Navigate to
where you cloned this repo and select any file there.

Select `Enable add-on debugging` to debug/devel.

The extension will stay loaded until you reset the browser.
